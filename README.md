# Break Check
 This is a program that will tell the user to take a break if they have been sitting in front of their computer for too long.

One user detection layer is utilizing the webcam and OpenCV to visually see if there is a user sitting in front of the computer for a given amount of time.
There should also be break length detection, to make sure the user has actually taken a break from the screen.
The point is to keep the user from staying in front of their computer screen for an extended amount of time with no interruptions. To keep a healthy mind, people need breaks. The point of this software is to tell the user to get up, move around, look away from the computer screen for a moment. This is like what the apple watch does when it detects that the user has been sitting for too long, it will tell them to stand up.
